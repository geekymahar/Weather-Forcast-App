## Documentation for Weather API Service

### Overview
This Python script provides a weather information service using the OpenWeatherMap API. It is built using the Flask framework and allows users to retrieve weather data by providing either the city name or latitude/longitude coordinates.

### Code Explanation
1. **Dependencies**:
   - Flask: A web framework for Python that provides tools for building web applications.
   - jsonify: A function from Flask used to serialize data into JSON format.
   - request: Module from Flask to handle incoming HTTP requests.
   - requests: An external library used to make HTTP requests to APIs.
   - flask_cors: Extension for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Flask applications.

2. **Code Summary**:
   - The script creates a Flask app instance and enables CORS support.
   - It defines a route '/weather' that accepts GET requests.
   - The `get_weather` function processes the request parameters ('city', 'lat', 'lon') and constructs the appropriate URL for the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - If required parameters are missing, an error response is returned.
   - The script makes a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the constructed URL and returns the JSON response.

### Tools Required
To run this code and set up the Weather API service, the following tools and dependencies are required:
- Python: The programming language in which the script is written.
- Flask: Install using `pip install Flask`.
- Flask-CORS: Install using `pip install Flask-Cors`.
- Requests: Install using `pip install requests`.
- Text Editor/IDE: For editing and running the Python script.
- Terminal/Command Prompt: To execute the Python script.

### Running the Code
1. Save the provided Python script in a file (e.g., `weather_api.py`).
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install Flask Flask-Cors requests`.
3. Run the script with `python weather_api.py`.
4. Access the Weather API service at `http://localhost:5000/weather`.

By following these steps, you can set up and run the Weather API service to retrieve weather information based on user input.
